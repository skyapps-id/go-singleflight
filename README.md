## âœ… Conclusion: Impact of singleflight Optimization
The performance test clearly demonstrates that introducing singleflight into your Go application results in significant efficiency and responsiveness improvements under high concurrency:

## ðŸš€ Key Improvements:
- +1,255 more requests handled in the same duration â€” a 17% throughput gain.
- Average response time reduced by 533 ms, improving user experience.
- P90â€“P99 latencies improved, indicating faster performance even under peak load.
- Requests/second increased by 3.78, proving better system scalability.
- No increase in error rate â€” 0.00% in both runs, showing maintained reliability.

## ðŸ’¡ Interpretation:
By eliminating redundant processing for identical concurrent requests (e.g., same user ID), singleflight:
- Reduces backend/database strain
- Increases response efficiency
- Helps the application scale better under load

## ðŸ§  Recommendation:
Use singleflight for endpoints where:
- Duplicate requests for the same data are likely.
- Backend calls (DB, cache, or external API) are resource-intensive.
- You aim to improve performance without adding complexity.
Itâ€™s a simple and highly effective optimization for high-throughput Go APIs.
